# PDF-Thumbnail-Creator

## NPM package for creating thumbnails for uploaded files(PDFs).

As you might have observed, when a file is uploaded to Google Drive, it is shown in the form of a thumbnail. So in this project we will at first create the thumbnail for any uploaded pdf and then convert that node server to a NPM package.
 

## Guidelines
- [ ] Clone the repo and run the node server, replacing the file source in the app.js file.

- [ ] Currently the project contains code which extract the first page of the pdf into an array buffer.

- [ ] You can either continue to work on the same code or you can suggest a totally different approach to achieve the same. 
  
- [ ] Work on building a node server. Converting it into a package is not so complex. 

System requirements:

  

- [ ] Make sure node version 12 or higher is installed on your system.

- [ ] Make sure yarn version 1.19.1 or higher is installed on your system.
